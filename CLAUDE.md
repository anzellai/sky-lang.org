# CLAUDE.md — Sky Language Project

> **Entry point for Claude Code.** The coding guide for this project lives in
> **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — it's agent-agnostic (Claude, Copilot, Cursor,
> Codex, …) and is imported below. Read it before writing any Sky.
>
> Keep AGENTS.md as the single source of truth; this file only exists so Claude
> Code picks the guide up automatically. `sky doc <Module>` is the live stdlib
> API (never drifts — generated from source); prefer it over any hand-copied
> table.

## Response style (INVIOLABLE)

Every response to the user, and every agent report, follows these rules.

1. Write in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Keep each sentence short.
   Put one idea in each sentence. Use the active voice. Use the present tense
   where you can. Use common, approved words.
2. Use British English spelling. For example, write behaviour, colour, organise,
   licence, and whilst.
3. Use plain punctuation. Do not use em-dashes, en-dashes, semicolons, or emoji.
   Use full stops and commas.
4. Do not use filler or marketing words. For example, do not write robust,
   seamless, leverage, delve, comprehensive, powerful, or effortless. State the
   fact plainly.

This rule governs prose in chat and in reports. It does not change code, code
comments, identifiers, or quoted output.

## Claude Code — operational notes

Everything about *writing* Sky is in AGENTS.md. This section covers only what
Claude Code has to do differently because it runs commands in a session.

### `sky db start` leaves a process running after the command exits

With `[database] embedded = true`, the cluster's lifetime follows the verb:

- **`sky run` / `sky watch` are ephemeral** — they start this project's cluster
  and stop it when they exit (ref-counted, so two concurrent runs don't stop
  each other's database). Nothing to clean up.
- **`sky db start` is persistent** — it starts the cluster in `.skydata/pg/` on
  a unix socket and *returns*, leaving it up until `sky db stop`. That is the
  point (it's the mode for running `./sky-out/app` repeatedly), but it means the
  usual "the command finished, so nothing of mine is running" assumption is
  wrong here.

So: check with `sky db ps` (this project) or `sky db ps --all` (every cluster on
the machine) rather than assuming; and stop what you started with `sky db stop`
before declaring a task done, unless the user is going to keep working against
it. Never `pkill postgres` — a machine can carry one cluster per project and the
user may have a system PostgreSQL of their own, and `sky db stop` already
targets exactly this project's.

### Don't run `sky db provision` speculatively

`sky db provision --embed` fetches a PostgreSQL bundle over the network and pins
it; `--shared` provisions against a host cluster. Both are deliberate,
side-effecting acts an operator makes once — not something to try in order to
see what happens. Ask the user first.

`provision --embed` fetches a **published** bundle (`postgres-bundle-v18.6`) for
the host platform — **linux and macOS only** (amd64/arm64). It needs a **glibc**
userland: it runs on any normal Linux VM/laptop and on debian-slim/distroless
containers, but **not** on Alpine (musl), bare `FROM scratch`, or Windows — and a
database wants durable storage, so it fits a VM or a container-with-a-volume, not
a stateless function. On an unsupported host use `sky db start` with a system
PostgreSQL, or a `DATABASE_URL`. Full matrix: `docs/skydb/embedded-postgres.md`.

### Embedded PostgreSQL and an explicit DSN together are an error

The app never knows which tier it is in — it consumes a DSN, and only the
provisioner changes. So `embedded = true` (or `--embed`) alongside `path` /
`url` / `SKY_DB_PATH` / `DATABASE_URL` is refused *before the build*, not
resolved by precedence: preferring the cluster would have the app writing to a
throwaway local directory while the user believes it is talking to the server
they named. If you are handed a DSN, do not add `--embed` "to be safe" — pick
the tier the user asked for.
